# 📦 Demand Forecasting Model for Inventory Management  

## 🚀 Introduction  
Organizations often struggle with accurate demand forecasting, leading to stockouts or excess inventory. This project aims to build an advanced **Machine Learning (ML)-based Demand Forecasting Model** to optimize inventory management and enhance operational efficiency.

## 🏆 Problem Statement  
Inefficient inventory management results in:  
- **Stockouts**, causing lost sales and dissatisfied customers.  
- **Overstocking**, leading to high storage costs and wastage.  
Our model aims to balance **supply and demand** by accurately predicting future inventory needs.  

## 🔥 Why is this Important?  
✔️ Prevents overstocking & understocking.  
✔️ Enhances operational efficiency.  
✔️ Reduces waste & improves cash flow.  
✔️ Helps businesses plan better staffing & logistics.  

## 🎯 Objective  
To develop an **ML-based forecasting model** that analyzes historical sales data & market trends, providing **accurate demand predictions**. This will help industries optimize inventory, reduce waste, and **improve overall profitability**.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - 📊 `Matplotlib` - Data visualization  
  - 📈 `Numpy` - Numerical computations  
  - 🏗️ `Pandas` - Data processing  
  - 🎨 `Seaborn` - Statistical plotting  
  - 🤖 `Sklearn` - Machine learning models  
- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **IDE Used:** Google Colab  

## 📊 Data & Visualization  
The dataset includes historical meal orders and various influencing parameters such as:  
- Center ID, Cuisine Type, Category  
- Meal Prices, Weekly Demand Trends  
- Marketing Influence (Emails, Ads, Promotions)  

### 📈 Key Visualizations  
- **Orders per week (Time Series Analysis)**  
- **Order variations based on Center ID, Cuisine, Category**  
- **Impact of price on demand**  
- **Effectiveness of marketing strategies (Email vs. No Email Campaigns)**  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used  
1️⃣ **Linear Regression** → Gave blunt predictions, with high error margins.  
2️⃣ **Decision Tree Regressor** – Improved accuracy but still lacked robustness.  
3️⃣ **Random Forest & XGBoost** – Provided the best results by combining multiple decision trees for a more **accurate** and **robust** prediction.

### 📌 Model Evaluation  
- **Predicted Orders (Green) vs. Actual Orders (Blue)**  
- **Future Demand Forecasting for 10 weeks**  
- **Marketing Impact Analysis on Order Growth**  

## 📡 Implementation Plan  
🔹 **Web App / Mobile App**: Businesses & industries can integrate our solution to predict inventory requirements dynamically.  
🔹 **Automated Inventory Adjustment**: Optimize procurement & storage based on demand forecasts.  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
✔️ More **data-driven insights** for inventory optimization.  
✔️ **AI-powered automation** for real-time inventory management.  
✔️ Expanding to **supply chain & logistics management**.  
✔️ **Sustainability-focused** forecasting to **reduce food & product waste**.
